## Overview

This project is a two-player adaptation of the popular Crossy Road game, where players control their characters by moving their hand muscles. The game leverages a bio amp exg pill to capture muscle signals, which are then processed by an Arduino Uno connected to a laptop. Players can navigate their characters by moving their right arm to go right, left arm to go left, and both arms to move straight.

## Features

- **Bio Amp EXG Integration:** The game uses a bio amp exg pill to capture hand muscle movements for player input.
- **Two-Player Mode:** Play with a friend and compete to cross the road successfully.
- **Intuitive Controls:** Move your right arm to go right, left arm to go left, and both arms to move straight.
- **Obstacle Challenges:** Navigate through various obstacles and challenges on your way to the other side.
